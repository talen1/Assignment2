Project Files
Stack.h: Header file for the Stack class.
Stack.cpp: Implementation file for the Stack class.
SingleLinkedList.h: Header file for the Single_Linked_List class.
SingleLinkedList.cpp: Implementation file for the Single_Linked_List class.

Compilation Instructions
To compile the program, ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
g++ -o program main.cpp Stack.cpp SingleLinkedList.cpp

This command compiles the main.cpp, Stack.cpp, and SingleLinkedList.cpp files and links them into an executable named program.

Running the Program
After compiling, run the program by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
./program
On Windows:
program.exe
The program will demonstrate the functionality of the Stack and Single Linked List classes, including pushing and popping elements, as well as inserting and removing elements from the list.
